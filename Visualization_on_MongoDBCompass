Steps to create visualizations on MongoDB Compass for SpecSense data:

1. Download MongoDB Compass from: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=hero#compass
2. Once downloaded, open Compass and fill in the details for the MongoDB database that you want to connect to. In our case, it is the Kaa Sandbox (130.245.144.229) MongoDB database. Usually, we just need to enter the host correctly, other details like port number etc. remain same.
3. When Compass connects to the database, find the logs for our appliacation by matching the application token for SpecSense application on the Kaa servers. The log names are available as logs_<application_token>
4. Once we are in our logs, navigate to the Schema tab.
5. In the filter field on the Schema tab, enter a filter. Ex: {'event.frequency':{$ne:0}} (This filter fetches all log records where the sampled frequency is not equal to zero. There are other operators available, which will be displayed in the autocomplete options)
6. After entering the filter, if it is syntactically correct, the 'Analyze' button next to the filter field will get activated. Click on 'Analyze'.
7. Now you will see the graphs created. You will have to unfold the 'event' tag to see the stats for power, frequency and iq. The nodenumber is another field to know how much data came from which of the nodes. This nodenumber is hardcoded in the code that runs on each of the endpoints.
